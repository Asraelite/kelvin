FTL version:

In the year 2204 humans a great human scientist discovered a new method of using the Alcubierre drive that allowed
for efficiency never seen before. A large ship could now travel hundreds of light-years in days rather than only
small probes with huge engines and fuel tanks that were discarded when used barely reaching the next star system in 10
years. This led to a revolution in space travel, and the human civilisation quickly expanded because of it.

Humans expanded to new star systems and the few habitable planets that they found were settled upon. Eventually though,
some colonies seeked to break free from the oppressive Earth States Republic which had strict control over the expansion
of colonies and heavily taxed everything so that those in power would be wealthy. These colonies were silenced and
never heard of again, until one of them, after secretly building up a defense army, defeated the wave of Earth States
Republic ships that had been sent to destroy the colony. This allowed them to get their message out and seek support
from other colones.

This led to the formation of a Rebellion Fleet that had growing power, but was still far superior to the Earth States
Republic. The Rebels rely on small Hit and Run attacks to disrupt the Republic. There are also numerous pirate and
Outer Colony factions who are rarely heard of.

Kelvin takes place during this time in the year 2237 and you can play as a Republican, a Rebel, or a Pirate.

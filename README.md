Kelvin
======

Kelvin is a 2D HTML5 Canvas Javascript space game in which you build ships, fly around in them and walk around the interior controlling various parts of the ship and fixing things.

You will also be able to battle other ships, dock with stations and ships, fly around in space in a jetpack, mine minor planets, board enemy ships and fight them, use your money to buy larger ships and then create an alliance to gain ownership of part of the star system. You may also be able to go between star systems but I'm not sure if I'll add that or not...
